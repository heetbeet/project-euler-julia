<h2>Problem 555: McCarthy 91 function</h2>
<p>
The McCarthy 91 function is defined as follows:
$$
M_{91}(n) = 
    \begin{cases}
        n - 10 &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 100 \\
        M_{91}(M_{91}(n+11)) &amp; \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq 100
    \end{cases}
$$
</p>
<p>
We can generalize this definition by abstracting away the constants into new variables:

$$
M_{m,k,s}(n) = 
    \begin{cases}
        n - s &amp; \text{if } n &gt; m \\
        M_{m,k,s}(M_{m,k,s}(n+k)) &amp; \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq m
    \end{cases}
$$
</p>
<p>
This way, we have $M_{91} = M_{100,11,10}$.
</p>
<p>
Let $F_{m,k,s}$ be the set of fixed points of $M_{m,k,s}$. That is, 

$$F_{m,k,s}= \left\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \, | \, M_{m,k,s}(n) = n \right\}$$
</p>
<p>
For example, the only fixed point of $M_{91}$ is $n = 91$. In other words, $F_{100,11,10}= \{91\}$.
</p> 
<p>
Now, define $SF(m,k,s)$ as the sum of the elements in $F_{m,k,s}$ and let $S(p,m) = \displaystyle \sum_{1 \leq s &lt; k \leq p}{SF(m,k,s)}$.

<h2>Problem 556: Squarefree Gaussian Integers</h2>
<p>A <b>Gaussian integer</b> is a number <var>z</var> = <var>a</var> + <var>b</var>i where <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> are integers and i<sup>2</sup> = -1.<br />
Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers are the subset of Gaussian integers for which <var>b</var> = 0.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer <b>unit</b> is one for which <var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> = 1, i.e. one of 1, i, -1, -i.<br />
Let's define a <i>proper</i> Gaussian integer as one for which <var>a</var> &gt; 0 and <var>b</var> ≥ 0.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer z<sub>1</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + <var>b</var><sub>1</sub>i is said to be divisible by <var>z</var><sub>2</sub> = a<sub>2</sub> + <var>b</var><sub>2</sub>i if <var>z</var><sub>3</sub> = <var>a</var><sub>3</sub> + <var>b</var><sub>3</sub>i = <var>z</var><sub>1</sub>/<var>z</var><sub>2</sub> is a Gaussian integer.<br />
$\frac {z_1} {z_2} = \frac {a_1 + b_1 i} {a_2 + b_2 i} = \frac {(a_1 + b_1 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} {(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} = \frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2} + \frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}i = a_3 + b_3 i$<br />
So, <var>z</var><sub>1</sub> is divisible by <var>z</var><sub>2</sub> if $\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ and $\frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ are integers.<br />
For example, 2 is divisible by 1 + i because 2/(1 + i) = 1 - i is a Gaussian integer.</p>

<p>A <b>Gaussian prime</b> is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself or itself times a unit.<br />
For example, 1 + 2i is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by 1, i, -1, -i, 1 + 2i, i(1 + 2i) = i - 2, -(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i and -i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i.<br />
2 is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by 1 + i.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper Gaussian primes.<br />
For example 2 = -i(1 + i)<sup>2</sup> and 1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i).<br />
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.<br />
So 2 is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but 1 + 3i is.<br />
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.</p>

<p>Let <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with <var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> ≤ n.<br />
For example <var>f</var>(10) = 7 because 1, 1 + i, 1 + 2i, 1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i), 2 + i, 3 and 3 + i = -i(1 + i)(1 + 2i) are squarefree, while 2 = -i(1 + i)<sup>2</sup> and 2 + 2i = -i(1 + i)<sup>3</sup> are not.<br />
You are given <var>f</var>(10<sup>2</sup>) = 54, <var>f</var>(10<sup>4</sup>) = 5218 and <var>f</var>(10<sup>8</sup>) = 52126906.</p>

<h2>Problem 557: Cutting triangles</h2>
<p>
A triangle is cut into four pieces by two straight lines, each starting at one vertex and ending on the opposite edge. This results in forming three smaller triangular pieces, and one quadrilateral.  If the original triangle has an integral area, it is often possible to choose cuts such that all of the four pieces also have integral area.  For example, the diagram below shows a triangle of area 55 that has been cut in this way.
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p557-triangle.gif" alt="p557-triangle.gif" /></div>
<p>
Representing the areas as <var>a, b, c</var> and <var>d</var>, in the example above, the individual areas are <var>a</var> = 22, <var>b</var> = 8, <var>c</var> = 11 and <var>d</var> = 14.  It is also possible to cut a triangle of area 55 such that <var>a</var> = 20, <var>b</var> = 2, <var>c</var> = 24, <var>d</var> = 9.</p>
<p>
Define a triangle cutting quadruple (<var>a, b, c, d</var>) as a valid integral division of a triangle, where <var>a</var> is the area of the triangle between the two cut vertices, <var>d</var> is the area of the quadrilateral and <var>b</var> and <var>c</var> are the areas of the two other triangles, with the restriction that <var>b ≤ c</var>.  The two solutions described above are (22,8,11,14) and (20,2,24,9).  These are the only two possible quadruples that have a total area of 55.
</p>
<p>
Define S(<var>n</var>) as the sum of the area of the uncut triangles represented by all valid quadruples with <var>a+b+c+d</var> ≤ <var>n</var>.<br /> For example, S(20) = 259.

Every positive integer can be written as the sum of distinct increasing powers of <var>r</var>.<br />
If we require the number of terms to be finite and the difference between any two exponents to be three or more, then the representation is unique.<br />

<h2>Problem 563: Robot Welders</h2>
<p>A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets, starting from unit square metal plates.  The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size.  Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process up to 25 identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including 25), and whether to weld the long or short edge.</p>

<p>For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together 11 raw unit square plates to make a 11×1 strip.  The next could take 10 of these 11×1 strips, and weld them either to make a longer 110×1 strip, or a 11×10 rectangle.  Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal sheets can be constructed in this way.</p>

<p>One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more than 10% larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For example, if the order calls for a metal sheet of area 889200, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: 900×988, 912×975 and 936×950.  The target area of 889200 is the smallest area which can be manufactured in three different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.</p>

<p>Let M(n) be the minimal area that can be manufactured in <u>exactly</u> n variants with the longer edge not greater than 10% bigger than the shorter edge.  Hence M(3) = 889200.</p>

<h2>Problem 564: Maximal polygons</h2>
<p>A line segment of length $2n-3$ is randomly split into $n$ segments of integer length ($n \ge 3$). In the sequence given by this split, the segments are then used as consecutive sides of a convex $n$-polygon, formed in such a way that its area is maximal.  All of the $\binom{2n-4} {n-1}$ possibilities for splitting up the initial line segment occur with the same probability. </p>

<p>Let $E(n)$ be the expected value of the area that is obtained by this procedure.<br />
For example, for $n=3$ the only possible split of the line segment of length $3$ results in three line segments with length $1$, that form an equilateral triangle with an area of $\frac 1 4 \sqrt{3}$. Therefore $E(3)=0.433013$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.<br />
For $n=4$ you can find $4$ different possible splits, each of which is composed of three line segments with length $1$ and one line segment with length $2$. All of these splits lead to the same maximal quadrilateral with an area of $\frac 3 4 \sqrt{3}$, thus $E(4)=1.299038$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.</p>

<p>Let $S(k)=\displaystyle \sum_{n=3}^k E(n)$.<br />

He then rotates the cake by 60 degrees counterclockwise, cuts an adjacent 60 degree piece and flips it upside down.<br />
He keeps repeating this, until after a total of twelve steps, all the icing is back on top.</p>

<p>Amazingly, this works for any piece size, even if the cutting angle is an irrational number: all the icing will be back on top after a finite number of steps.</p>

<p>Now, Adam tries something different: he alternates cutting pieces of size $x=\frac{360}{9}$ degrees, $y=\frac{360}{10}$ degrees and $z=\frac{360 }{\sqrt{11}}$ degrees. The first piece he cuts has size <var>x</var> and he flips it. The second has size <var>y</var> and he flips it. The third has size <var>z</var> and he flips it. He repeats this with pieces of size <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> and <var>z</var> in that order until all the icing is back on top, and discovers he needs 60 flips altogether.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p566-cakeicingpuzzle.gif" alt="p566-cakeicingpuzzle.gif" /></div>

Let $G(n) = \sum_{9 \le a &lt; b &lt; c \le n} F(a,b,c)$, for integers <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> and <var>c</var>.</p>

<h2>Problem 567: Reciprocal games I</h2>
<p>Tom has built a random generator that is connected to a row of $n$ light bulbs. Whenever the random generator is activated each of the $n$ lights is turned on with the probability of $\frac 1 2$, independently of its former state or the state of the other light bulbs.</p>

<p>While discussing with his friend Jerry how to use his generator, they invent two different games, they call the <i>reciprocal games</i>:<br />
Both games consist of $n$ turns. Each turn is started by choosing a number $k$ randomly between (and including) $1$ and $n$, with equal probability of $\frac 1 n$ for each number, while the possible win for that turn is the reciprocal of $k$, that is $\frac 1 k$.</p>

<p>In game A, Tom activates his random generator once in each turn. If the number of lights turned on is the same as the previously chosen number $k$, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing for that turn. Jerry's expected win after playing the total game A consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_A(n)$. For example $J_A(6)=0.39505208$, rounded to 8 decimal places.</p>

<p>For each turn in game B, after $k$ has been randomly selected, Tom keeps reactivating his random generator until exactly $k$ lights are turned on. After that Jerry takes over and reactivates the random generator until he, too, has generated a pattern with exactly $k$ lights turned on. If this pattern is identical to Tom's last pattern, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing. Jerry's expected win after the total game B consisting of $n$ turns is called $J_B(n)$. For example $J_B(6)=0.43333333$, rounded to 8 decimal places.</p>

<h2>Problem 573: Unfair race</h2>
<p>$n$ runners in very different training states want to compete in a race. Each one of them is given a different starting number $k$ $(1\leq k \leq n)$ according to the runner's (constant) individual racing speed being $v_k=\frac{k}{n}$.<br />
In order to give the slower runners a chance to win the race, $n$ different starting positions are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) and independently from each other within the racing track of length $1$. After this, the starting position nearest to the goal is assigned to runner $1$, the next nearest starting position to runner $2$ and so on, until finally the starting position furthest away from the goal is assigned to runner $n$. The winner of the race is the runner who reaches the goal first.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the expected running time for the winner is $\frac{1}{2}$, independently of the number of runners. Moreover, while it can be shown that all runners will have the same expected running time of $\frac{n}{n+1}$, the race is still unfair, since the winning chances may differ significantly for different starting numbers:</p>

<p>Let $P_{n,k}$ be the probability for runner $k$ to win a race with $n$ runners and $E_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k P_{n,k}$ be the expected starting number of the winner in that race. It can be shown that, for example,
$P_{3,1}=\frac{4}{9}$, $P_{3,2}=\frac{2}{9}$, $P_{3,3}=\frac{1}{3}$ and $E_3=\frac{17}{9}$ for a race with $3$ runners. <br />
You are given that $E_4=2.21875$, $E_5=2.5104$ and $E_{10}=3.66021568$.</p>

<h2>Problem 574: Verifying Primes</h2>
<p>Let $q$ be a prime and $A \ge B &gt;0$ be two integers with the following properties:
</p><ul><li> $A$ and $B$ have no prime factor in common, that is $\text{gcd}(A,B)=1$.</li>
<li> The product $AB$ is divisible by every prime less than q.</li>

</ul><p>It can be shown that, given these conditions, any sum $A+B&lt;q^2$ and any difference $1&lt;A-B&lt;q^2$ has to be a prime number. Thus you can verify that a number $p$ is prime by showing that either $p=A+B&lt;q^2$ or $p=A-B&lt;q^2$ for some $A,B,q$ fulfilling the conditions listed above.</p>

<p>Let $V(p)$ be the smallest possible value of $A$ in any sum $p=A+B$ and any difference $p=A-B$, that verifies $p$ being prime. Examples:<br />
$V(2)=1$, since $2=1+1&lt; 2^2$. <br />
$V(37)=22$, since $37=22+15=2 \cdot 11+3 \cdot 5&lt; 7^2$ is the associated sum with the smallest possible $A$.<br />
$V(151)=165$ since $151=165-14=3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 - 2 \cdot 7&lt;13^2$ is the associated difference with the smallest possible $A$. </p>
<p>
Let $S(n)$ be the sum of $V(p)$ for all primes $p&lt;n$. For example, $S(10)=10$ and $S(200)=7177$.</p>

<h2>Problem 575: Wandering Robots</h2>
<p>It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as if from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.</p>

<p>She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png" alt="p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png" />
</div>

<p>Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.</p>

<p>Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png" alt="p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png" /><br />
<div style="font-style:italic;">(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits</div>
<br />
<img src="project/images/p575_wandering_robot_3_dynamic.png" alt="p575_wandering_robot_3_dynamic.png" /><br />
<div style="font-style:italic;">(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining</div>
</div>

<p>The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.</p>

<p>Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].</p>

<p>In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.<br />
(Give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places)</p>
