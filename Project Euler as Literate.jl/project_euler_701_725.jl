<h2>Problem 702: Jumping Flea</h2>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p702_jumping_flea.png" alt="hexagonal table" />

<p>An flea of negligible size is jumping on this table. The flea starts at the centre of the table. Thereafter, at each step, it chooses one of the six corners of the table, and jumps to the mid-point between its current position and the chosen corner.</p>

<p>For every triangle $T$, we denote by $J(T)$ the minimum number of jumps required for the flea to reach the interior of $T$. Landing on an edge or vertex of $T$ is not sufficient.</p>

<p>For example, $J(T) = 3$ for the triangle marked with a star in the picture: by jumping from the centre half way towards F, then towards C, then towards E.</p>

<p>Let $S(N)$ be the sum of $J(T)$ for all the upper-pointing triangles $T$ in the upper half of the table. For the case $N = 3$, these are the triangles painted black in the above picture.</p>

<h2>Problem 710: One Million Members</h2>
<h4>On Sunday 5 April 2020 the Project Euler membership first exceeded one million members. We would like to present this problem to celebrate that milestone. Thank you to everyone for being a part of Project Euler.</h4>

<p>The number 6 can be written as a palindromic sum in exactly eight different ways:</p>
$$(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (1, 4, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2), (3, 3), (6)$$

<p>We shall define a <dfn>twopal</dfn> to be a palindromic tuple having at least one element with a value of 2. It should also be noted that elements are not restricted to single digits. For example, $(3, 2, 13, 6, 13, 2, 3)$ is a valid twopal.</p>

<p>If we let $t(n)$ be the number of twopals whose elements sum to $n$, then it can be seen that $t(6) = 4$:</p>
$$(1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2)$$

<p>Similarly, $t(20) = 824$.</p>

<p>In searching for the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, it can be verified that $t(42) = 1999923$, which happens to be the first value of $t(n)$ that exceeds one million.</p>

<p>However, your challenge to the "ultimatest" question of life, the universe, and everything is to find the least value of $n \gt 42$ such that $t(n)$ is divisible by one million.</p>

<h2>Problem 716: Grid Graphs</h2>

Consider a directed graph made from an orthogonal lattice of $H\times W$ nodes. 
The edges are the horizontal and vertical connections between adjacent nodes.
$W$ vertical directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction. Similarly, $H$ horizontal directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction.
</p>
<p>
Two nodes, $A$ and $B$ in a directed graph, are <b>strongly connected</b> if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from $A$ to $B$ as well as from $B$ to $A$. Note that every node is strongly connected to itself.
</p>
<p>
A <b>strongly connected component</b> in a directed graph is a non-empty set $M$ of nodes satisfying the following two properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>All nodes in $M$ are strongly connected to each other.</li>
<li>$M$ is maximal, in the sense that no node in $M$ is strongly connected to any node outside of $M$.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are $2^H\times 2^W$ ways of drawing the directed lines. Each way gives a directed graph $\mathcal{G}$. We define $S(\mathcal{G})$ to be the number of strongly connected components in $\mathcal{G}$.

When inscribed into a circle with radius $r$, a triangle with sides $a$, $b$ and $c$ is pythagorean, if and only if $a^2+b^2+c^2=8\, r^2$.</p>

<p>Analogously, we call a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with sides $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, inscribed in a circle with radius $r$, a <i>pythagorean quadrilateral</i>, if $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=8\, r^2$. <br />
We further call a pythagorean quadrilateral a <i>pythagorean lattice grid quadrilateral</i>, if all four vertices are lattice grid points with the same distance $r$ from the origin $O$ (which then happens to be the centre of the circumcircle).</p>
<p>
Let $f(r)$ be the number of different pythagorean lattice grid quadrilaterals for which the radius of the circumcircle is $r$. For example $f(1)=1$, $f(\sqrt 2)=1$, $f(\sqrt 5)=38$ and $f(5)=167$.<br /> 
Two of the pythagorean lattice grid  quadrilaterals with $r=\sqrt 5$ are illustrated below:</p>

Let $\displaystyle S(n)=\sum_{d \vert n} f(\sqrt d)$. For example, $S(325)=S(5^2 \cdot 13)=f(1)+f(\sqrt 5)+f(5)+f(\sqrt {13})+f(\sqrt{65})+f(5\sqrt{13})=2370$ and $S(1105)=S(5\cdot 13 \cdot 17)=5535$.</p>
<p>
Find $S(1411033124176203125)=S(5^6 \cdot 13^3 \cdot 17^2 \cdot 29 \cdot 37 \cdot 41 \cdot 53 \cdot 61)$.</p>

<h2>Problem 724: Drone Delivery</h2>
<p>A depot uses $n$ drones to disperse packages containing essential supplies along a long straight road.<br />
Initially all drones are stationary, loaded with a supply package.<br />
Every second, the depot selects a drone at random and sends it this instruction:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are stationary, start moving at one centimetre per second along the road.</li>
<li>If you are moving, increase your speed by one centimetre per second along the road without changing direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The road is wide enough that drones can overtake one another without risk of collision.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will only be one drone left at the depot waiting to receive its first instruction. As soon as that drone has flown one centimetre along the road, all drones drop their packages and return to the depot.</p>

<p>Let $E(n)$ be the expected distance in centimetres from the depot that the supply packages land.<br />
For example, $E(2) = \frac{7}{2}$, $E(5) = \frac{12019}{720}$, and $E(100) \approx 1427.193470$.</p>
<p>Find $E(10^8)$. Give your answer rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

<h2>Problem 725: Digit sum numbers</h2>
<p>
A number where one digit is the sum of the <b>other</b> digits is called a <i>digit sum number</i> or DS-number for short. For example, 352, 3003 and 32812 are DS-numbers.
</p>
<p>
We define $S(n)$ to be the sum of all DS-numbers of $n$ digits or less.
</p>
<p>
You are given $S(3) = 63270$ and $S(7) = 85499991450$.
</p>
<p>
Find $S(2020)$. Give your answer modulo $10^{16}$.
