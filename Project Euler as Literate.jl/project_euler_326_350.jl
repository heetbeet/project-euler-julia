<h2>Problem 327: Rooms of Doom</h2>
<p>A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p327_rooms_of_doom.gif" alt="p327_rooms_of_doom.gif" /></div>

<p>Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.</p>

<p>If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in that room forever!</p>

<p>However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible. For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you to travel through all three rooms using six security cards in total.</p>

<p>It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of 123 security cards while carrying a maximum of 3 cards.</p>

<p>Let <var>C</var> be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any time.</p>
<p>Let <var>R</var> be the number of rooms to travel through.</p>
<p>Let M(<var>C</var>,<var>R</var>) be the minimum number of cards required from the dispensing machine to travel through <var>R</var> rooms carrying up to a maximum of <var>C</var> cards at any time.</p>

<p>For example, M(3,6)=123 and M(4,6)=23.<br />And, <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">∑</span></span> M(<var>C</var>,6)=146 for 3 ≤ <var>C</var> ≤ 4.</p>

<h2>Problem 328: Lowest-cost Search</h2>
<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, has a <u>cost equal to the number asked</u> and we get one of three possible answers:<br /></p><ul><li> "Your guess is lower than the hidden number", or</li>
<li> "Yes, that's it!", or</li>
<li> "Your guess is higher than the hidden number".</li>
</ul><p>Given the value of <var>n</var>, an <i>optimal strategy</i> minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) <u>for the worst possible case</u>. E.g.</p>

<p>If <var>n</var>=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "<b>2</b>". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).</p>

<p>If <var>n</var>=8, we might decide to use a "binary search" type of strategy: Our first question would be "<b>4</b>" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions.<br />
Let our second question be "<b>6</b>". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.<br />
Thus, our third question will be "<b>7</b>" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=<span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>17</b></span>.</p>

<p>We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for <var>n</var>=8, by asking "<b>5</b>" as our first question.<br />
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be "<b>7</b>", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=<span style="color:#3333FF;"><b>12</b></span>).<br />
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be "<b>3</b>" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be "<b>1</b>", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=<span style="color:#3333FF;"><b>9</b></span>.<br />
Since <span style="color:#3333FF;"><b>12</b></span>&gt;<span style="color:#3333FF;"><b>9</b></span>, the worst-case cost for this strategy is <span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>12</b></span>. That's better than what we achieved previously with the "binary search" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.<br />
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for <var>n</var>=8.</p>

<p>Let C(<var>n</var>) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for <var>n</var>, as described above.<br />
Thus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.<br />
Similarly, C(100) = 400 and $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{100} {C(n)} = 17575$.</p>

<p>Find $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{200000} {C(n)}$ .</p>

<h2>Problem 333: Special partitions</h2>
<p>All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and every term of the partition can be expressed as 2<sup>i</sup>x3<sup>j</sup>, where i,j ≥ 0.</p>

<p>Let's consider only such partitions where none of the terms can divide any of the other terms.
<br />For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (2<sup>1</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup>x3<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>2</sup>) would not be valid since 2 can divide 6. Neither would the partition 17 = 16 + 1 = (2<sup>4</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>0</sup>) since 1 can divide 16. The only valid partition of 17 would be 8 + 9 = (2<sup>3</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11 having the following two partitions.
<br />11 = 2 + 9 = (2<sup>1</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>2</sup>)

<h2>Problem 336: Maximix Arrangements</h2>
<p>A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order. <br />
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.<br />
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been achieved.</p>

<p>However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.</p>

<p>Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call <i>maximix arrangements</i>, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown below.</p>

<p>For any positive integer <var>k</var>, a finite sequence a<sub><var>i</var></sub> of fractions x<sub><var>i</var></sub>/y<sub><var>i</var></sub> is defined by:<br />
a<sub>1</sub> = 1/<var>k</var> and<br />
a<sub><var>i</var></sub> = (x<sub><var>i</var>-1</sub>+1)/(y<sub><var>i</var>-1</sub>-1) reduced to lowest terms for <var>i</var>&gt;1.<br />
When a<sub><var>i</var></sub> reaches some integer <var>n</var>, the sequence stops. (That is, when y<sub><var>i</var></sub>=1.)<br />
Define f(<var>k</var>) = <var>n</var>. <br />
For example, for <var>k</var> = 20:
</p>

<p>
1/20 → 2/19 → 3/18 = 1/6 → 2/5 → 3/4 → 4/3 → 5/2 → 6/1 = 6
</p>

<p>
So f(20) = 6.
</p>

<p>
Also f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1 and <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">∑</span></span> f(<var>k</var><sup>3</sup>) = 118937 for 1 ≤ <var>k</var> ≤ 100.
</p>

<p>
Find <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">∑</span></span> f(<var>k</var><sup>3</sup>) for 1 ≤ <var>k</var> ≤ 2×10<sup>6</sup>.

<h2>Problem 344: Silver dollar game</h2>
<p>One variant of N.G. de Bruijn's <b>silver dollar</b> game can be described as follows:</p>

<p>On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per square. Only one coin, called the <b>silver dollar</b>, has any value. Two players take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either a <i>regular</i> or a <i>special</i> move.</p>

<p>A <i>regular</i> move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on or over another coin.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the player can choose to make the <i>special</i> move of pocketing the leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no regular moves are possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost coin.</p>

<p>The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.</p>


<div align="center">
<img src="project/images/p344_silverdollar.gif" alt="p344_silverdollar.gif" /><br /></div>

<p>A <i>winning configuration</i> is an arrangement of coins on the strip where the first player can force a win no matter what the second player does.</p>

<p>Let W(<var>n</var>,<var>c</var>) be the number of winning configurations for a strip of <var>n</var> squares, <var>c</var> worthless coins and one silver dollar.</p>

<p>You are given that W(10,2) = 324 and W(100,10) = 1514704946113500.</p>

<p>Find W(1 000 000, 100) modulo the semiprime 1000 036 000 099 (= 1 000 003 · 1 000 033).

<h2>Problem 346: Strong Repunits</h2>
<p>
The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2, and 11 written in base 6 <br />(i.e. 7<sub>10</sub> = 11<sub>6</sub> = 111<sub>2</sub>). In other words, 7 is a repunit in at least two bases b &gt; 1. 
</p>
<p>
We shall call a positive integer with this property a strong repunit. It can be verified that there are 8 strong repunits below 50:  {1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43}. <br />Furthermore, the sum of all strong repunits below 1000 equals 15864.

<h2>Problem 347: Largest integer divisible by two primes</h2>
<p>
The largest integer ≤ 100 that is only divisible by both the primes 2 and 3 is 96, as 96=32*3=2<sup>5</sup>*3.
For two <i>distinct</i> primes p and q let M(p,q,N) be the largest positive integer ≤N only divisible
by both p and q and M(p,q,N)=0 if such a positive integer does not exist.
</p>
<p>
E.g. M(2,3,100)=96.<br /> 
M(3,5,100)=75 and not 90 because 90 is divisible by 2 ,3 and 5.<br />
Also M(2,73,100)=0 because there does not exist a positive integer ≤ 100 that is divisible by both 2 and 73.
</p>
<p>
Let S(N) be the sum of all distinct M(p,q,N).
S(100)=2262.
</p>
<p>
Find S(10 000 000).

<h2>Problem 349: Langton's ant</h2>
<p>
An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black or white.<br /> 
The ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left, right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according to the following rules:<br />
- if it is on a black square, it flips the colour of the square to white, rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square.<br />
- if it is on a white square, it flips the colour of the square to black, rotates 90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.<br /></p>
<p>
Starting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after 10<sup>18</sup> moves of the ant?

<h2>Problem 350: Constraining the least greatest and the greatest least</h2>
<p>A <i>list of size n</i> is a sequence of <var>n</var> natural numbers.<br /> Examples are (2,4,6), (2,6,4), (10,6,15,6), and (11).
</p><p>
The <b>greatest common divisor</b>, or gcd, of a list is the largest natural number that divides all entries of the list. <br />Examples: gcd(2,6,4) = 2, gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1 and gcd(11) = 11.
</p><p>
The <b>least common multiple</b>, or lcm, of a list is the smallest natural number divisible by each entry of the list. <br />Examples: lcm(2,6,4) = 12, lcm(10,6,15,6) = 30 and lcm(11) = 11.
</p><p>
Let f(<var>G</var>, <var>L</var>, <var>N</var>) be the number of lists of size <var>N</var> with gcd ≥ <var>G</var> and lcm ≤ <var>L</var>. For example:
