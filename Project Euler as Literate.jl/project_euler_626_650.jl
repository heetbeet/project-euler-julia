<h2>Problem 626: Counting Binary Matrices</h2>
<p>A binary matrix is a matrix consisting entirely of 0s and 1s. Consider the following transformations that can be performed on a binary matrix:</p>

<ul>
<li>Swap any two rows</li>
<li>Swap any two columns</li>
<li>Flip all elements in a single row (1s become 0s, 0s become 1s)</li>
<li>Flip all elements in a single column</li>
</ul>

<p>Two binary matrices $A$ and $B$ will be considered <i>equivalent</i> if there is a sequence of such transformations that when applied to $A$ yields $B$. For example, the following two matrices are equivalent:</p>
$A=\begin{pmatrix} 
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} \quad B=\begin{pmatrix} 
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}$
<p>via the sequence of two transformations "Flip all elements in column 3" followed by "Swap rows 1 and 2".</p>

<p>Define $c(n)$ to be the maximum number of $n\times n$ binary matrices that can be found such that no two are equivalent. For example, $c(3)=3$. You are also given that $c(5)=39$ and $c(8)=656108$.</p>

<p>Find $c(20)$, and give your answer modulo $1\,001\,001\,011$.</p>

<h2>Problem 628: Open chess positions</h2>
<p>
A position in chess is an (orientated) arrangement of chess pieces placed on a chessboard of given size. In the following, we consider all positions in which $n$ pawns are placed on a  $n \times n$  
board in such a way, that there is a single pawn in every row and every column.

</p>
<p>
We call such a position an <i>open</i> position, if a rook, starting at the (empty) lower left corner and using only moves towards the right or upwards, can reach the upper right corner without moving onto any field occupied by a pawn. 
</p>
<p>Let $f(n)$ be the number of open positions for a $n \times n$ chessboard.<br />
For example, $f(3)=2$, illustrated by the two open positions for a $3  \times 3$ chessboard below.

</p>

<h2>Problem 629: Scatterstone Nim</h2>
<p>Alice and Bob are playing a modified game of Nim called Scatterstone Nim, with Alice going first, alternating turns with Bob. The game begins with an arbitrary set of stone piles with a total number of stones equal to $n$.</p>

<p>During a player's turn, he/she must pick a pile having at least $2$ stones and perform a split operation, dividing the pile into an arbitrary set of $p$ non-empty, arbitrarily-sized piles where $2 \leq p \leq k$ for some fixed constant $k$. For example, a pile of size $4$ can be split into $\{1, 3\}$ or $\{2, 2\}$, or $\{1, 1, 2\}$ if $k = 3$ and in addition $\{1, 1, 1, 1\}$ if $k = 4$.</p>

<p>If no valid move is possible on a given turn, then the other player wins the game.</p>

<p>A winning position is defined as a set of stone piles where a player can ultimately ensure victory no matter what the other player does. </p>

<p>Let $f(n,k)$ be the number of winning positions for Alice on her first turn, given parameters $n$ and $k$. For example, $f(5, 2) = 3$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}$. In contrast, $f(5, 3) = 5$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{5\}$.</p>

<p>Let $g(n)$ be the sum of $f(n,k)$ over all $2 \leq k \leq n$. For example, $g(7)=66$ and $g(10)=291$.</p>

<p>Find $g(200)$ mod $(10^9 + 7)$.</p>

<h2>Problem 630: Crossed lines</h2>
<p>
Given a set, $L$, of unique lines, let $M(L)$ be the number of lines in the set and let $S(L)$ be the sum over every line of the number of times that line is crossed by another line in the set.  For example, two sets of three lines are shown below:
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p630_threelines.png" alt="crossed lines" /></div>
<p>
In both cases M(L) is 3 and S(L) is 6: each of the three lines is crossed by two other lines.  Note that even if the lines cross at a single point, all of the separate crossings of lines are counted.
</p>
<p>
Consider points ($T_{2k−1}$, $T_{2k}$), for integer $k &gt;= 1$, generated in the following way:
</p>
<p>
$S_0 	=  	290797$<br /> 
$S_{n+1} 	=  	{S_n}^2 \:\: \rm{mod} \:\: 50515093$<br />
$T_n 	=  	( S_n \:\: \rm{mod} \:\: 2000 ) − 1000$
</p>
<p>
For example, the first three points are: (527, 144), (−488, 732), (−454, −947).  Given the first $n$ points generated in this manner, let $L_n$ be the set of <b>unique</b> lines that can be formed by joining each point with every other point, the lines being extended indefinitely in both directions.  We can then define $M(L_n)$ and $S(L_n)$ as described above.
</p>
<p>
For example, $M(L_3) = 3$ and $S(L_3) = 6$.  Also $M(L_{100}) = 4948$ and $S(L_{100}) = 24477690$.

<h2>Problem 631: Constrained Permutations</h2>

<p>Define an <i>occurrence</i> of a permutation $p=(p_1 p_2 \ldots p_k)$ in a permutation $P=(P_1 P_2 \ldots P_n)$ to be a sequence $1\leq t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_k \leq n$ such that $p_i &lt; p_j$ if and only if $P_{t_i} &lt; P_{t_j}$ for all $i,j \in \{1, ..., k\}$.</p>

<p>For example, $(1243)$ occurs twice in the permutation $(314625)$: once as the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th elements $(3\,\,46\,\,5)$, and once as the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th elements $(\,\,146\,\,5)$.</p>

<p>Let $f(n, m)$ be the number of permutations $P$ of length at most $n$ such that there is no occurrence of the permutation $1243$ in $P$ and there are at most $m$ occurrences of the permutation $21$ in $P$.</p>

<p>For example, $f(2,0) = 3$, with the permutations $()$, $(1)$, $(1,2)$ but not $(2,1)$.</p>

<h2>Problem 636: Restricted Factorisations</h2>

<h2>Problem 644: Squares on the line</h2>

<p>As illustrated below, the squares may be positioned in two different ways, either "straight" by placing the midpoints of two opposite sides on the line segment, or "diagonal" by placing two opposite corners on the line segment. Newly placed squares may touch other squares, but are not allowed to overlap any other square laid down before.<br />

With Sam starting each game by placing the first square, they quickly realise that Sam can easily win every time by placing the first square in the middle of the line segment, making the game boring. </p>

Therefore they decide to randomise Sam's first move, by first tossing a fair coin to determine whether the square will be placed straight or diagonal onto the line segment and then choosing the actual position on the line segment randomly with all possible positions being equally likely. Sam's gain of the game is defined to be 0 if he loses the game and $L$ if he wins. Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam's initial move, you can see that Sam's expected gain, called $e(L)$, is only dependent on the length of the line segment.</p>
<p>
For example, if $L=2$, Sam will win with a probability of 1, so $e(2)= 2$. <br />
Choosing $L=4$, the winning probability will be 0.33333333 for the straight case and 0.22654092 for the diagonal case, leading to $e(4)=1.11974851$ (rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point each). </p>
<p>
Being interested in the optimal value of $L$ for Sam, let's define $f(a,b)$ to be the maximum of $e(L)$ for some $L \in [a,b]$. <br />
You are given $f(2,10)=2.61969775$, being reached for $L= 7.82842712$, and $f(10,20)=
5.99374121$ (rounded to 8 digits each).</p>

<h2>Problem 645: Every Day is a Holiday</h2>
<p>On planet J, a year lasts for $D$ days. Holidays are defined by the two following rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>At the beginning of the reign of the current Emperor, his birthday is declared a holiday from that year onwards.</li>
<li>If both the day before and after a day $d$ are holidays, then $d$ also becomes a holiday.</li>
</ol>
<p>Initially there are no holidays. Let $E(D)$ be the expected number of Emperors to reign before all the days of the year are holidays, assuming that their birthdays are independent and uniformly distributed throughout the $D$ days of the year.</p>
<p>You are given $E(2)=1$, $E(5)=31/6$, $E(365)\approx 1174.3501$.</p>

<h2>Problem 647: Linear Transformations of Polygonal Numbers</h2>
<p>
It is possible to find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any triangular number, $T_n$, then $AT_n +B$ is always a triangular number. We define $F_3(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$. For example $F_3(100) = 184$.
</p>
<p>
Polygonal numbers are generalisations of triangular numbers. Polygonal numbers with parameter $k$ we call $k$-gonal numbers. The formula for the $n$th $k$-gonal number is $\frac 12n\big(n(k-2)+4-k\big)$ where $n \ge 1$. For example when $k = 3$ we get $\frac 12n(n+1)$ the formula for triangular numbers.
</p>
<p>
The statement above is true for pentagonal, heptagonal and in fact any $k$-gonal number with $k$ odd. For example when $k=5$ we get the pentagonal numbers and we can find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any pentagonal number, $P_n$, then $AP_n+B$ is always a pentagonal number. We define $F_5(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$.
</p>
<p>
Similarly we define $F_k(N)$ for odd $k$. You are given $\sum_{k} F_k(10^3) = 14993$ where the sum is over all odd $k = 3,5,7,\ldots$.
</p>

<h2>Problem 648: Skipping Squares</h2>
<p>For some fixed $\rho \in [0, 1]$, we begin a sum $s$ at $0$ and repeatedly apply a process: With probability $\rho$, we add $1$ to $s$, otherwise we add $2$ to $s$.</p>

<p>The process ends when either $s$ is a perfect square or $s$ exceeds $10^{18}$, whichever occurs first. For example, if $s$ goes through $0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9$, the process ends at $s=9$, and two squares $1$ and $4$ were skipped over.</p>

<p>Let $f(\rho)$ be the expected number of perfect squares skipped over when the process finishes.</p>

<p>It can be shown that the power series for $f(\rho)$ is $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k \rho^k$ for a suitable (unique) choice of coefficients $a_k$. Some of the first few coefficients are $a_0=1$, $a_1=0$, $a_5=-18$, $a_{10}=45176$.</p>

<p>Let $F(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k$. You are given that $F(10) = 53964$ and $F(50) \equiv 842418857 \pmod{10^9}$.</p>

<h2>Problem 649: Low-Prime Chessboard Nim</h2>
Alice and Bob are taking turns playing a game consisting of $c$ different coins on a chessboard of size $n$ by $n$.

<p>The game may start with any arrangement of $c$ coins in squares on the board. It is possible at any time for more than one coin to occupy the same square on the board at the same time. The coins are distinguishable, so swapping two coins gives a different arrangement if (and only if) they are on different squares.</p>

<p>On a given turn, the player must choose a coin and move it either left or up $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$ spaces in a single direction. The only restriction is that the coin cannot move off the edge of the board.</p>

<p>The game ends when a player is unable to make a valid move, thereby granting the other player the victory.</p>

<p>Assuming that Alice goes first and that both players are playing optimally, let $M(n, c)$ be the number of possible starting arrangements for which Alice can ensure her victory, given a board of size $n$ by $n$ with $c$ distinct coins.</p>

<p>For example, $M(3, 1) = 4$, $M(3, 2) = 40$, and $M(9, 3) = 450304$.</p>

<p>What are the last $9$ digits of $M(10\,000\,019, 100)$?</p>
