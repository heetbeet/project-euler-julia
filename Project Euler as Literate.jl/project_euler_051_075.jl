<h2>Problem 51: Prime digit replacements</h2>
<p>By replacing the 1<sup>st</sup> digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.</p>
<p>By replacing the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.</p>

<h2>Problem 54: Poker hands</h2>
<p>In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:</p>
<ul><li><b>High Card</b>: Highest value card.</li>
<li><b>One Pair</b>: Two cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Two Pairs</b>: Two different pairs.</li>
<li><b>Three of a Kind</b>: Three cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Straight</b>: All cards are consecutive values.</li>
<li><b>Flush</b>: All cards of the same suit.</li>
<li><b>Full House</b>: Three of a kind and a pair.</li>
<li><b>Four of a Kind</b>: Four cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Straight Flush</b>: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.</li>
<li><b>Royal Flush</b>: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.</li>
</ul><p>The cards are valued in the order:<br />2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.</p>
<p>If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.</p>
<p>Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:</p>

<h2>Problem 55: Lychrel numbers</h2>
<p>If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.</p>
<p>Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,</p>
<p class="margin_left">349 + 943 = 1292,<br />
1292 + 2921 = 4213<br />
4213 + 3124 = 7337</p>
<p>That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.</p>
<p>Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.</p>
<p>How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?</p>

<h2>Problem 57: Square root convergents</h2>

<p class="center">$\sqrt 2 =1+ \frac 1 {2+ \frac 1 {2 +\frac 1 {2+ \dots}}}$</p>
<p>By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:</p>
<p>$1 + \frac 1 2 = \frac  32 = 1.5$<br />
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 2} = \frac 7 5 = 1.4$<br />

$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}}} = \frac {41}{29} = 1.41379 \dots$<br /></p>

<h2>Problem 59: XOR decryption</h2>
<p>Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.</p>
<p>A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.</p>
<p>For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.</p>
<p>Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using <a href="project/resources/p059_cipher.txt">p059_cipher.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.</p>

<h2>Problem 64: Odd period square roots</h2>
<p>All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:</p>

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{N}=a_0+\frac 1 {a_1+\frac 1 {a_2+ \frac 1 {a3+ \dots}}}$

<p>For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$</p>
$\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac 1 {\frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac 1  {1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$

<p>If we continue we would get the following expansion:</p>

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {3+ \frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {8+ \dots}}}}$

<p>The process can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>
$\quad \quad a_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$<br />
$\quad \quad a_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$<br />
$\quad \quad a_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$<br />
$\quad \quad a_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} 7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$<br />
$\quad \quad a_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$<br />
$\quad \quad a_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7 (\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$<br />

$\quad \quad a_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$<br />
$\quad \quad a_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} {7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$<br />
</p>

<p>It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the notation $\sqrt{23}=[4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.</p>

<p>The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$, $(2)$ indicates that 2 repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23} = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$.</p>
<p>It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.</p>

1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2}\\
1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\

1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} = \dfrac{41}{29}

<h2>Problem 69: Totient maximum</h2>
<p>Euler's Totient function, φ(<i>n</i>) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than <i>n</i> which are relatively prime to <i>n</i>. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.</p>

<h2>Problem 70: Totient permutation</h2>
<p>Euler's Totient function, φ(<var>n</var>) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to <var>n</var> which are relatively prime to <var>n</var>. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.<br />The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1. </p>
<p>Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.</p>
<p>Find the value of <var>n</var>, 1 &lt; <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>7</sup>, for which φ(<var>n</var>) is a permutation of <var>n</var> and the ratio <var>n</var>/φ(<var>n</var>) produces a minimum.</p>

<h2>Problem 71: Ordered fractions</h2>
<p>Consider the fraction, <i>n/d</i>, where <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> are positive integers. If <i>n</i>&lt;<i>d</i> and HCF(<i>n,d</i>)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.</p>
<p>If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:</p>

<p>It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.</p>

<h2>Problem 73: Counting fractions in a range</h2>
<p>Consider the fraction, <i>n/d</i>, where <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> are positive integers. If <i>n</i>&lt;<i>d</i> and HCF(<i>n,d</i>)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.</p>

<h2>Problem 74: Digit factorial chains</h2>
<p>The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:</p>
<p class="margin_left">1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145</p>
<p>Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:</p>
<p class="margin_left">169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169<br />
871 → 45361 → 871<br />
872 → 45362 → 872</p>
<p>It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,</p>
<p class="margin_left">69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)<br />
78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)<br />
540 → 145 (→ 145)</p>
<p>Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.</p>
<p>How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?</p>

<h2>Problem 75: Singular integer right triangles</h2>
<p>It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are many more examples.</p>
<p class="margin_left"><b>12 cm</b>: (3,4,5)<br /><b>24 cm</b>: (6,8,10)<br /><b>30 cm</b>: (5,12,13)<br /><b>36 cm</b>: (9,12,15)<br /><b>40 cm</b>: (8,15,17)<br /><b>48 cm</b>: (12,16,20)</p>
<p>In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.</p>
<p class="margin_left"><b>120 cm</b>: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)</p>
<p>Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L ≤ 1,500,000 can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?</p>
