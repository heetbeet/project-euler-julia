<h2>Problem 601: Divisibility streaks</h2>
<p>
For every positive number $n$ we define the function  $streak(n)=k$   as the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $n+k$ is not divisible by $k+1$.<br />
E.g:<br />
13 is divisible by 1 <br />
14 is divisible by 2 <br />
15 is divisible by 3 <br />
16 is divisible by 4 <br />
17 is NOT divisible by 5 <br />
So $streak(13) = 4$. <br /> 
Similarly:<br />
120 is divisible by 1 <br />
121 is NOT divisible by 2 <br />
So $streak(120) = 1$.</p>
<p>

Define $P(s, N)$ to be the number of integers $n$, $1 &lt; n &lt; N$, for which $streak(n) = s$.<br />
So $P(3, 14) = 1$ and $P(6, 10^6) = 14286$.
</p>
<p>
Find the sum, as $i$ ranges from 1 to 31, of $P(i, 4^i)$.

<h2>Problem 602: Product of Head Counts</h2>
<p>
Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number, using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and, starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies all her friends' Head counts together to obtain her random number.
</p>
<p>
As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn, who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the sequence of Head/Tail outcomes <b>THHH—TTTT—THHT—H</b> beginning and ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn obtains 1 head. Alice's random number is therefore $2\times 2\times 1 = 4$.
</p>
<p>
Define $e(n, p)$ to be the expected value of Alice's random number, where $n$ is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself), and $p$ is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that, for any fixed $n$, $e(n, p)$ is always a polynomial in $p$. For example, $e(3, p) = p^3 + 4p^2 + p$.
</p>
<p>
Define $c(n, k)$ to be the coefficient of $p^k$ in the polynomial $e(n, p)$. So $c(3, 1) = 1$, $c(3, 2) = 4$, and $c(3, 3) = 1$.

<h2>Problem 607: Marsh Crossing</h2>
<p>
Frodo and Sam need to travel 100 leagues due East from point A to point B. On normal terrain, they can cover 10 leagues per day, and so the journey would take 10 days. However, their path is crossed by a long marsh which runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking through the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50 leagues wide at all points, and the mid-point of AB is located in the middle of the marsh. A map of the region is shown in the diagram below:
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p607_marsh.png" alt="p607_marsh.png" /></div>


<p>
The marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues across, as shown by the shading in the map. The strip closest to point A is relatively light marsh, and can be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per day. However, each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate, the speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues per day for the final region of marsh, before it ends and the terrain becomes easier again, with the speed going back to 10 leagues per day.
</p>
<p>
If Frodo and Sam were to head directly East for point B, they would travel exactly 100 leagues, and the journey would take approximately 13.4738 days. However, this time can be shortened if they deviate from the direct path.
</p>

<h2>Problem 610: Roman Numerals II</h2>
<p>A random generator produces a sequence of symbols drawn from the set {<span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">I</span>, <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">V</span>, <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">X</span>, <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">L</span>, <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">C</span>, <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">D</span>, <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">M</span>, <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">#</span>}. Each item in the sequence is determined by selecting one of these symbols at random, independently of the other items in the sequence. At each step, the seven letters are equally likely to be selected, with probability 14% each, but the <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">#</span> symbol only has a 2% chance of selection.</p>

<p>We write down the sequence of letters from left to right as they are generated, and we stop at the first occurrence of the <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">#</span> symbol (without writing it). However, we stipulate that what we have written down must always (when non-empty) be a valid Roman numeral representation in minimal form. If appending the next letter would contravene this then we simply skip it and try again with the next symbol generated.</p>

<p>Please take careful note of <a href="about=roman_numerals">About... Roman Numerals</a> for the definitive rules for this problem on what constitutes a "valid Roman numeral representation" and "minimal form". For example, the (only) sequence that represents 49 is <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">XLIX</span>. The subtractive combination <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">IL</span> is invalid because of rule (ii), while <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">XXXXIX</span> is valid but not minimal. The rules do not place any restriction on the number of occurrences of <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">M</span>, so all positive integers have a valid representation. These are the same rules as were used in <a href="problem=89">Problem 89</a>, and members are invited to solve that problem first.</p>

<p>Find the expected value of the number represented by what we have written down when we stop. (If nothing is written down then count that as zero.) Give your answer rounded to 8 places after the decimal point.</p>

The planets are permitted to overlap one another, but the boundaries of $S$ and $C$ must be at least 1cm apart at their closest point.</p>

<p>Now suppose that these circles are actually gears with perfectly meshing teeth at a pitch of 1cm. $C$ is an internal gear with teeth on the inside. We require that $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$ are all integers (as they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear must have at least 5 teeth.</p>

<p>Note that "perfectly meshing" means that as the gears rotate, the ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice versa. Only for certain gear sizes and positions will it be possible for $S$ and $C$ each to mesh perfectly with all the planets. Arrangements where not all gears mesh perfectly are not valid.</p>

<p>Define $g(c,s,p,q)$ to be the number of such gear arrangements for given values of $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$: it turns out that this is finite as only certain discrete arrangements are possible satisfying the above conditions. For example, $g(16,5,5,6)=9$.</p>

<li>Any <i>variable</i> $x$ (single letter, from some infinite alphabet) is a lambda-term.</li>
<li>If $M$ and $N$ are lambda-terms, then $(M N)$ is a lambda-term, called the <i>application</i> of $M$ to $N$.</li>
<li>If $x$ is a variable and $M$ is a term, then $(\lambda x. M)$ is a lambda-term, called an <i>abstraction</i>. An abstraction defines an anonymous function, taking $x$ as parameter and sending back $M$.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lambda-term $T$ is said to be <i>closed</i> if for all variables $x$, all occurrences of $x$ within $T$ are contained within some abstraction $(\lambda x. M)$ in $T$. The smallest such abstraction is said to <i>bind</i> the occurrence of the variable $x$. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term $(\lambda x. x)$ is closed, while the term $(\lambda x. (x y))$ is not because $y$ is not bound.</p>

<p>Also, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that $(\lambda x. x)$ and $(\lambda y. y)$ should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called <i>$\alpha$-equivalent</i>. Note that $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda x. (\lambda x. (x x)))$ are not $\alpha$-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one. However, $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda y. (\lambda x. (y x)))$ are $\alpha$-equivalent.</p>

<p>The following table regroups the lambda-terms that can be written with at most $15$ symbols, symbols being parenthesis, $\lambda$, dot and variables.</p>

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
(\lambda x.x) &amp; (\lambda x.(x x)) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.x)) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.y)) \\
\hline
(\lambda x.(x (x x))) &amp; (\lambda x.((x x) x)) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.(x x))) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.(x y))) \\
\hline
(\lambda x.(\lambda y.(y x))) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.(y y))) &amp; (\lambda x.(x (\lambda y.x))) &amp; (\lambda x.(x (\lambda y.y))) \\
\hline
(\lambda x.((\lambda y.x) x)) &amp; (\lambda x.((\lambda y.y) x)) &amp; ((\lambda x.x) (\lambda x.x)) &amp; (\lambda x.(x (x (x x)))) \\
\hline
(\lambda x.(x ((x x) x))) &amp; (\lambda x.((x x) (x x))) &amp; (\lambda x.((x (x x)) x)) &amp; (\lambda x.(((x x) x) x)) \\
\hline
\end{array}\]

<p>Let be $\Lambda(n)$ the number of distinct closed lambda-terms that can be written using at most $n$ symbols, where terms that are $\alpha$-equivalent to one another should be counted only once. You are given that $\Lambda(6) = 1$, $\Lambda(9) = 2$, $\Lambda(15) = 20$ and $\Lambda(35) = 3166438$.</p>
<p>Find $\Lambda(2000)$. Give the answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.</p>

<h2>Problem 624: Two heads are better than one</h2>
<p>
An unbiased coin is tossed repeatedly until two consecutive heads are obtained. Suppose these occur on the $(M-1)$th and $M$th toss.<br />
Let $P(n)$ be the probability that $M$ is divisible by $n$. For example, the outcomes HH, HTHH, and THTTHH all count towards $P(2)$, but THH and HTTHH do not.</p>
<p>
You are given that $P(2) =\frac 3 5$ and $P(3)=\frac 9  {31}$. Indeed, it can be shown that $P(n)$ is always a rational number.</p>
<p>
For a prime $p$ and a fully reduced fraction $\frac a b$, define $Q(\frac a b,p)$ to be the smallest positive $q$ for which $a \equiv b q \pmod{p}$.<br />
For example $Q(P(2), 109) = Q(\frac 3 5, 109) = 66$, because $5 \cdot 66 = 330 \equiv 3 \pmod{109}$ and 66 is the smallest positive such number.<br />
Similarly $Q(P(3),109) = 46$.</p>
<p>
Find $Q(P(10^{18}),1\,000\,000\,009)$.</p>
