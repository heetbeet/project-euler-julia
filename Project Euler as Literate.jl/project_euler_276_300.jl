<h2>Problem 277: A Modified Collatz sequence</h2>
<p>
A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value $a_1$ in the following way:</p>
<p>
$a_{n+1} = \, \,\, \frac {a_n} 3 \quad$ if $a_n$ is divisible by $3$. We shall denote this as a large downward step, "D".</p>
<p>
$a_{n+1} = \frac {4 a_n+2} 3 \, \,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $1$. We shall denote this as an upward step, "U".
</p>
<p>
$a_{n+1} = \frac {2 a_n -1} 3 \, \,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $2$. We shall denote this as a small downward step, "d".
</p>


<p>
The sequence terminates when some $a_n = 1$.
</p>
<p>
Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.<br />
For instance if $a_1=231$, then the sequence $\{a_n\}=\{231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1\}$ corresponds to the steps "DdDddUUdDD".
</p>
<p>
Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence "DdDddUUdDD....".<br />
For instance, if $a_1=1004064$, then the sequence is DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.<br />
In fact, $1004064$ is the smallest possible $a_1 &gt; 10^6$ that begins with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.
</p>
<p>
What is the smallest $a_1 &gt; 10^{15}$ that begins with the sequence "UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd"?

<h2>Problem 278: Linear Combinations of Semiprimes</h2>
<p>
Given the values of integers $1 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \dots &lt; a_n$, consider the linear combination<br />
$q_1 a_1+q_2 a_2 + \dots + q_n a_n=b$, using only integer values $q_k \ge 0$. 
</p>
<p>
Note that for a given set of $a_k$, it may be that not all values of $b$ are possible.<br />
For instance, if $a_1=5$ and $a_2=7$, there are no $q_1 \ge 0$ and $q_2 \ge 0$ such that $b$ could be<br /> 
$1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18$ or $23$.
<br />
In fact, $23$ is the largest impossible value of $b$ for $a_1=5$ and $a_2=7$.<br /> We therefore call $f(5, 7) = 23$.<br /> Similarly, it can be shown that $f(6, 10, 15)=29$ and $f(14, 22, 77) = 195$.

<h2>Problem 280: Ant and seeds</h2>
<p>A laborious ant walks randomly on a 5x5 grid. The walk starts from the central square. At each step, the ant moves to an adjacent square at random, without leaving the grid; thus there are 2, 3 or 4 possible moves at each step depending on the ant's position.</p>

<p>At the start of the walk, a seed is placed on each square of the lower row. When the ant isn't carrying a seed and reaches a square of the lower row containing a seed, it will start to carry the seed. The ant will drop the seed on the first empty square of the upper row it eventually reaches.</p>

<h2>Problem 284: Steady Squares</h2>

<p>For example, if <var>k</var> = 6, <var>a</var> = 0.2 and <var>b</var> = 0.85, then (<var>k</var>·<var>a</var>+1)<sup>2</sup> + (<var>k</var>·<var>b</var>+1)<sup>2</sup> = 42.05.<br />
The square root of 42.05 is 6.484... and when rounded to the nearest integer, it becomes 6.<br />

<h2>Problem 299: Three similar triangles</h2>
<p>Four points with integer coordinates are selected:<br />A(<var>a</var>, 0), B(<var>b</var>, 0), C(0, <var>c</var>) and D(0, <var>d</var>), 
with 0 &lt; <var>a</var> &lt; <var>b</var> and 0 &lt; <var>c</var> &lt; <var>d</var>.<br />
Point P, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line AC so that the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP are all <dfn title="Have equal angles">similar</dfn>.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p299_ThreeSimTri.gif" class="dark_img" alt="p299_ThreeSimTri.gif" /></div>
<p>It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if <var>a</var>=<var>c</var>.</p>

<p>So, given that <var>a</var>=<var>c</var>, we are looking for triplets (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>d</var>) such that at least one point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.</p>

<p>For example, if (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>d</var>)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point P(1,1) satisfies the above condition. 
Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and (2,4,3) are considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for both.</p>

<p>If <var>b</var>+<var>d</var> &lt; 100, there are 92 distinct triplets (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>d</var>) such that point P exists.<br />
If <var>b</var>+<var>d</var> &lt; 100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>d</var>) such that point P exists.</p>
<p>If <var>b</var>+<var>d</var> &lt; 100 000 000, how many distinct triplets (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>d</var>) are there such that point P exists?</p>

<h2>Problem 300: Protein folding</h2>
<p>In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH. <br />
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> distinct proteins consisting of <var>n</var> elements.</p>

<p>When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.<br />
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.<br />
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in <u>two dimensions</u>.</p>

<p>The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).</p>

<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p300_protein.gif" alt="p300_protein.gif" /></div>

<p>The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally.<br />
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.</p>

<p>Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850 / 2<sup>8</sup>=3.3203125.</p>

<p>What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 15?<br />
Give your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact result.</p>
