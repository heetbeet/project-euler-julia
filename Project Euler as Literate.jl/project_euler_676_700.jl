<h2>Problem 676: Matching Digit Sums</h2>
<p>
Let $d(i,b)$ be the <b>digit sum</b> of the number $i$ in base $b$. For example $d(9,2)=2$, since $9=1001_2$.
When using different bases, the respective digit sums most of the time deviate from each other, for example $d(9,4)=3 \ne d(9,2)$.
</p>

<p>
However, for some numbers $i$ there will be a match, like $d(17,4)=d(17,2)=2$.
Let $ M(n,b_1,b_2)$ be the sum of all natural numbers $i \le n$ for which $d(i,b_1)=d(i,b_2)$.
For example, $M(10,8,2)=18$, $M(100,8,2)=292$ and $M(10^6,8,2)=19173952$.
</p>

<p>
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{k=3}^6 \sum_{l=1}^{k-2}M(10^{16},2^k,2^l)$, giving the last 16 digits as the answer.

<h2>Problem 678: Fermat-like Equations</h2>

<h2>Problem 683: The Chase II</h2>
<p>Consider the following variant of "The Chase" game. This game is played between $n$ players sitting around a circular table using two dice. It consists of $n-1$ rounds, and at the end of each round one player is eliminated and has to pay a certain amount of money into a pot. The last player remaining is the winner and receives the entire contents of the pot.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a round, each die is given to a randomly selected player. A round then consists of a number of turns.</p>

<p>During each turn, each of the two players with a die rolls it. If a player rolls a 1 or a 2, the die is passed to the neighbour on the left; if the player rolls a 5 or a 6, the die is passed to the neighbour on the right; otherwise, the player keeps the die for the next turn.</p>

<p>The round ends when one player has both dice at the beginning of a turn. At which point that player is immediately eliminated and has to pay $s^2$ where $s$ is the number of completed turns in this round. Note that if both dice happen to be handed to the same player at the beginning of a round, then no turns are completed, so the player is eliminated without having to pay any money into the pot.</p>

<p>Let $G(n)$ be the expected amount that the winner will receive. For example $G(5)$ is approximately 96.544, and $G(50)$ is 2.82491788e6 in scientific notation rounded to 9 significant digits.</p>

<h2>Problem 690: Tom and Jerry</h2>
<p>
Tom (the cat) and Jerry (the mouse) are playing on a simple graph $G$.
</p>
<p>
Every vertex of $G$ is a mousehole, and every edge of $G$ is a tunnel connecting two mouseholes.
</p>
<p>
Originally, Jerry is hiding in one of the mouseholes.<br />
Every morning, Tom can check one (and only one) of the mouseholes. If Jerry happens to be hiding there then Tom catches Jerry and the game is over.<br />
Every evening, if the game continues, Jerry moves to a mousehole which is adjacent (i.e. connected by a tunnel, if there is one available) to his current hiding place. The next morning Tom checks again and the game continues like this.
</p>
<p>
Let us call a graph $G$ a <i>Tom graph</i>, if our super-smart Tom, who knows the configuration of the graph but does not know the location of Jerry, can <i>guarantee</i> to catch Jerry in finitely many days.
For example consider all graphs on 3 nodes:
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p690_graphs.jpg" alt="Graphs on 3 nodes" />
</div>
<p>
For graphs 1 and 2, Tom will catch Jerry in at most three days. For graph 3 Tom can check the middle connection on two consecutive days and hence guarantee to catch Jerry in at most two days. These three graphs are therefore Tom Graphs. However, graph 4 is not a Tom Graph because the game could potentially continue forever.
</p>
<p>
Let $T(n)$ be the number of different Tom graphs with $n$ vertices. Two graphs are considered the same if there is a bijection $f$ between their vertices, such that $(v,w)$ is an edge if and only if $(f(v),f(w))$ is an edge.

<h2>Problem 696: Mahjong</h2>

(The real Mahjong game also contains other bonus tiles, but those will not feature in this problem.)</p>

<p>A <i>winning hand</i> is a collection of $3t+2$ Tiles (where $t$ is a fixed integer) that can be arranged as $t$ <i>Triples</i> and one <i>Pair</i>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <i>Triple</i> is either a <i>Chow</i> or a <i>Pung</i></li>
<li>A <i>Chow</i> is three tiles of the same suit and consecutive numbers</li>
<li>A <i>Pung</i> is three identical tiles (same suit and same number)</li>
<li>A <i>Pair</i> is two identical tiles (same suit and same number)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem 698: 123 Numbers</h2>
<p>
We define <i>123-numbers</i> as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>1 is the smallest 123-number.</li>
<li>When written in base 10 the only digits that can be present are "1", "2" and "3" and if present the number of times they each occur is also a 123-number.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So 2 is a 123-number, since it consists of one  digit "2" and 1 is a 123-number. Therefore, 33 is a 123-number as well since it consists of two digits "3" and 2 is a 123-number.<br />
On the other hand, 1111 is not a 123-number, since it contains 4 digits "1" and 4 is not a 123-number.
</p>
<p>
In ascending order, the first 123-numbers are:<br />
$1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 111, 112, 113, 121, 122, 123, 131, \ldots$
</p>
<p>
Let $F(n)$ be the $n$-th 123-number. For example $F(4)=11$, $F(10)=31$, $F(40)=1112$, $F(1000)=1223321$ and $F(6000)= 2333333333323$.
</p>
<p>
Find $F(111\,111\,111\,111\,222\,333)$. Give your answer modulo $123\,123\,123$.

<h2>Problem 699: Triffle Numbers</h2>
<p>
Let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of all the divisors of the positive integer $n$, for example:<br />
$\sigma(10) = 1+2+5+10 = 18$.
</p>
<p>
Define $T(N)$ to be the sum of all numbers $n \le N$ such that when the fraction $\frac{\sigma(n)}{n}$ is written in its lowest form $\frac ab$, the denominator is a power of 3 i.e. $b = 3^k, k &gt; 0$.
</p>
<p>
You are given $T(100) = 270$ and $T(10^6) = 26089287$.
</p>
<p>
Find $T(10^{14})$.

<h2>Problem 700: Eulercoin</h2>
<p>Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707.</p>

<p>Consider the sequence 1504170715041707<var>n</var> mod 4503599627370517.</p>

<p>An element of this sequence is defined to be an Eulercoin if it is strictly smaller than all previously found Eulercoins.</p>

<p>For example, the first term is 1504170715041707 which is the first Eulercoin.  The second term is 3008341430083414 which is greater than 1504170715041707 so is not an Eulercoin.  However, the third term is 8912517754604 which is small enough to be a new Eulercoin.</p>

<p>The sum of the first 2 Eulercoins is therefore 1513083232796311.</p>

<p>Find the sum of all Eulercoins.</p>
