<h2>Problem 84: Monopoly odds</h2>
<p>In the game, <i>Monopoly</i>, the standard board is set up in the following way:</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p084_monopoly_board.png" alt="p084_monopoly_board.png" />
</div>
<p>A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.</p>
<p>In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.</p>
<ul><li>Community Chest (2/16 cards):
<ol><li>Advance to GO</li>
<li>Go to JAIL</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Chance (10/16 cards):
<ol><li>Advance to GO</li>
<li>Go to JAIL</li>
<li>Go to C1</li>
<li>Go to E3</li>
<li>Go to H2</li>
<li>Go to R1</li>
<li>Go to next R (railway company)</li>
<li>Go to next R</li>
<li>Go to next U (utility company)</li>
<li>Go back 3 squares.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul><p>The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between "Just Visiting" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to "get out of jail", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.</p>
<p>By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.</p>
<p>Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.</p>
<p>If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.</p>

<h2>Problem 88: Product-sum numbers</h2>
<p>A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>} is called a product-sum number: N = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> + ... + <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> × <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> × ... × <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>.</p>
<p>For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.</p>
<p>For a given set of size, <i>k</i>, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, <i>k</i> = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.</p>
<p class="margin_left"><i>k</i>=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2<br /><i>k</i>=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3<br /><i>k</i>=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4<br /><i>k</i>=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2<br /><i>k</i>=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6</p>
<p>Hence for 2≤<i>k</i>≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.</p>

<h2>Problem 89: Roman numerals</h2>

<h2>Problem 90: Cube digit pairs</h2>
<p>Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.</p>

<p>For example, the square number 64 could be formed:</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p090.png" class="dark_img" alt="" /><br /></div>

<p>In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.</p>

<p>For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.</p>

<p>However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.</p>

<p>In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.</p>

<p class="margin_left">{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}<br />
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}</p>

<p>But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.</p>

<p>How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?</p>

<h2>Problem 93: Arithmetic expressions</h2>
<p>By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.</p>
<p>For example,</p>

14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)<br />

<h2>Problem 95: Amicable chains</h2>

<p>Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.</p>

<h2>Problem 96: Su Doku</h2>
<p>Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.</p>

</div>
<p>A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered <i>easy</i> because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.</p>
<p>The 6K text file, <a href="project/resources/p096_sudoku.txt">sudoku.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).</p>

<h2>Problem 100: Arranged probability</h2>
<p>If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)×(14/20) = 1/2.</p>
<p>The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.</p>
<p>By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10<sup>12</sup> = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.</p>
