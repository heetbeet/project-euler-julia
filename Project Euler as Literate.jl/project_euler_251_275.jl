<h2>Problem 252: Convex Holes</h2>
<p>
Given a set of points on a plane, we define a convex hole to be a convex polygon having as vertices any of the given points and not containing any of the given points in its interior (in addition to the vertices, other given points may lie on the perimeter of the polygon). 
</p>
<p>
As an example, the image below shows a set of twenty points and a few such convex holes. 
The convex hole shown as a red heptagon has an area equal to 1049694.5 square units, which is the highest possible area for a convex hole on the given set of points.
</p>
<div class="center">

<h2>Problem 253: Tidying up</h2>
<p>A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of forty jigsaw pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal the numbers 1 to 40 in order.</p>

<p>Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order.<br /> As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together.<br /> The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).</p><p>

</p><p>For example:</p>
<div class="center">
<table class="grid" style="margin:0 auto;"><tr><th width="80" align="center"><b>Piece Placed</b></th>
<th width="80" align="center"><b>Segments So Far</b></th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="center">29</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">34</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">35</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">…</td><td align="center">…</td></tr></table></div>

<p>Let <var>M</var> be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random tidy-up of the caterpillar.<br />
For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each <var>M</var> is</p>
<div class="center">
<table class="grid" style="margin:0 auto;"><tr><th width="50" align="center"><b><var>M</var></b></th>
<th width="90" align="center"><b>Possibilities</b></th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="right">512      </td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="right">250912      </td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="right">1815264      </td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="right">1418112      </td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="right">144000      </td></tr></table></div>

<p>so the most likely value of <var>M</var> is 3 and the average value is <sup>385643</sup>⁄<sub>113400</sub> = 3.400732, rounded to six decimal places.</p>

<p>The most likely value of <var>M</var> for a forty-piece caterpillar is 11; but what is the average value of <var>M</var>?</p>

<h2>Problem 255: Rounded Square Roots</h2>
<p>We define the <i>rounded-square-root</i> of a positive integer <var>n</var> as the square root of <var>n</var> rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

<p>The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of <var>n</var>:</p>
<p>Let <var>d</var> be the number of digits of the number <var>n</var>.<br />
If <var>d</var> is odd, set $x_0 = 2 \times 10^{(d-1)/2}$.<br />
If <var>d</var> is even, set $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(d-2)/2}$.<br />
Repeat:</p>
$$x_{k+1} = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{x_k + \lceil{n / x_k}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor$$

<p>until $x_{k+1} = x_k$.</p>
<p>As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of <var>n</var> = 4321.<br /><var>n</var> has 4 digits, so $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(4-2)/2} = 70$.<br />
$$x_1 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{70 + \lceil{4321 / 70}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$
$$x_2 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{66 + \lceil{4321 / 66}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$

Since $x_2 = x_1$, we stop here.<br />
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137…).
</p>
<p>The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low.<br />
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer (10,000 ≤ <var>n</var> ≤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).
</p>
<p>Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit number (10<sup>13</sup> ≤ <var>n</var> &lt; 10<sup>14</sup>)?<br />
Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
</p>
<p>Note: The symbols $\lfloor x \rfloor$ and $\lceil x \rceil$ represent the <dfn title="the largest integer not greater than x">floor function</dfn> and <dfn title="the smallest integer not less than x">ceiling function</dfn> respectively.

<h2>Problem 256: Tatami-Free Rooms</h2>
<span style="font-size:10pt;">
</span><p>Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>

<p>Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>

<p>For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> and even size <var>s</var> = <var>a</var>·<var>b</var>.<br />
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition <var>a</var> ≤ <var>b</var>.</p>

<p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.<br />
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="project/images/p256_tatami3.gif" alt="p256_tatami3.gif" /><br /></div>

<p>The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red "<span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>X</b></span>" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>

<p>Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.<br />
Further, we define <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var>.</p>

<p>The smallest tatami-free room has size <var>s</var> = 70 and dimensions 7×10.<br />
All the other rooms of size <var>s</var> = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.<br />
Hence, <var>T</var>(70) = 1.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can verify that <var>T</var>(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size <var>s</var> = 1320:<br />
20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.<br />
In fact, <var>s</var> = 1320 is the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 5.</p>

<p>Find the smallest room-size <var>s</var> for which <var>T</var>(<var>s</var>) = 200.</p>

<h2>Problem 260: Stone Game</h2>

On each player's turn, the player may remove one or more stones from the piles. However, if the player takes stones from more than one pile, then the same number of stones must be removed from each of the selected piles.</p>

<p>In other words, the player chooses some $N \gt 0$ and removes:</p>

<ul>
<li>$N$ stones from any single pile; or</li>
<li>$N$ stones from each of any two piles ($2N$ total); or</li>
<li>$N$ stones from each of the three piles ($3N$ total).</li>
</ul>

<p>The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.</p>

<p>A <dfn>winning configuration</dfn> is one where the first player can force a win.<br />
For example, $(0,0,13)$, $(0,11,11)$, and $(5,5,5)$ are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones.</p>

<p>A <dfn>losing configuration</dfn> is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does.<br />
For example, $(0,1,2)$ and $(1,3,3)$ are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.</p>

<p>Consider all losing configurations $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ where $x_i \le y_i \le z_i \le 100$.<br />

For example, P<sub>5703</sub>(<var>x</var>) = 5<var>x</var><sup>3</sup> + 7<var>x</var><sup>2</sup> + 3.</p>

<p>We can see that:</p><ul><li>P<sub><var>n</var></sub>(0) is the last digit of <var>n</var>,</li>
<li>P<sub><var>n</var></sub>(1) is the sum of the digits of <var>n</var>,</li>
<li>P<sub><var>n</var></sub>(10) is <var>n</var> itself.</li></ul><p>Define Z(<var>k</var>) as the number of positive integers, <var>n</var>, not exceeding <var>k</var> for which the polynomial P<sub><var>n</var></sub> has at least one integer root.</p>

<p>It can be verified that Z(100 000) is 14696.</p>

<h2>Problem 270: Cutting Squares</h2>
<p>A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N×N is placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the <var>x</var>- and <var>y</var>-axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:
</p><ul><li>We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.</li>
<li>Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.</li>
<li>Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.</li>
</ul><p>Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways to cut an N×N square. For example, C(1) = 2 and C(2) = 30 (shown below).</p>

<h2>Problem 273: Sum of Squares</h2>

<h2>Problem 274: Divisibility Multipliers</h2>
<p>For each integer <var>p</var> &gt; 1 coprime to 10 there is a positive <em>divisibility multiplier</em> <var>m</var> &lt; <var>p</var> which preserves divisibility by <var>p</var> for the following function on any positive integer, <var>n</var>:</p>

<p><var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) = (all but the last digit of <var>n</var>) + (the last digit of <var>n</var>) * <var>m</var></p>

<p>That is, if <var>m</var> is the divisibility multiplier for <var>p</var>, then <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) is divisible by <var>p</var> if and only if <var>n</var> is divisible by <var>p</var>.</p>

<p>(When <var>n</var> is much larger than <var>p</var>, <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) will be less than <var>n</var> and repeated application of <var>f</var> provides a multiplicative divisibility test for <var>p</var>.)</p>

<p>For example, the divisibility multiplier for 113 is 34.</p>

<p><var>f</var>(76275) = 7627 + 5 * 34 = 7797 : 76275 and 7797 are both divisible by 113<br /><var>f</var>(12345) = 1234 + 5 * 34 = 1404 : 12345 and 1404 are both not divisible by 113</p>

<p>The sum of the divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime to 10 and less than 1000 is 39517. What is the sum of the divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime to 10 and less than 10<sup>7</sup>?</p>

<h2>Problem 275: Balanced Sculptures</h2>
<p>Let us define a <i>balanced sculpture</i> of order <var>n</var> as follows:
</p><ul><li>A <dfn title="An arrangement of identical squares connected through shared edges; holes are allowed.">polyomino</dfn> made up of <var>n</var>+1 tiles known as the <i>blocks</i> (<var>n</var> tiles)<br /> and the <i>plinth</i> (remaining tile);</li>
<li>the plinth has its centre at position (<var>x</var> = 0, <var>y</var> = 0);</li>
<li>the blocks have <var>y</var>-coordinates greater than zero (so the plinth is the unique lowest tile);</li>
<li>the centre of mass of all the blocks, combined, has <var>x</var>-coordinate equal to zero.</li>
</ul><p>When counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply reflections about the <var>y</var>-axis, are <u>not</u> counted as distinct. For example, the 18 balanced sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each pair of mirror images (about the <var>y</var>-axis) is counted as one sculpture:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p275_sculptures2.gif" alt="p275_sculptures2.gif" /></div>

<p>There are 964 balanced sculptures of order 10 and 360505 of order 15.<br />How many balanced sculptures are there of order 18?</p>
