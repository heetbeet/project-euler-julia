<h2>Problem 376: Nontransitive sets of dice</h2>
<p>
Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:
</p>

<p>
Die A: 1 4 4 4 4 4<br />
Die B: 2 2 2 5 5 5<br />
Die C: 3 3 3 3 3 6<br /></p>

<p>
A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The player who rolls the highest value wins.
</p>

<p>
If the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get<br />
P(second player wins) = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>
If the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get<br />
P(second player wins) = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>
If the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get<br />
P(second player wins) = <sup>25</sup>/<sub>36</sub> &gt; <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>
So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning.<br />
A set of dice having this property is called a <b>nontransitive set of dice</b>.
</p>

<p>
We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will assume the following conditions:</p><ul><li>There are three six-sided dice with each side having between 1 and <var>N</var> pips, inclusive.</li>
<li>Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on the die the pips are located.</li>
<li>The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll the same value neither player wins.</li>
<li>The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.</li>
</ul><p>
For <var>N</var> = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets.<br />
How many are there for <var>N</var> = 30 ?

<h2>Problem 397: Triangle on parabola</h2>
<p>
On the parabola <var>y</var> = <var>x</var><sup>2</sup>/<var>k</var>, three points A(<var>a</var>, <var>a</var><sup>2</sup>/<var>k</var>), B(<var>b</var>, <var>b</var><sup>2</sup>/<var>k</var>) and C(<var>c</var>, <var>c</var><sup>2</sup>/<var>k</var>) are chosen.

<h2>Problem 398: Cutting rope</h2>
<p>
Inside a rope of length <var>n</var>, <var>n</var>-1 points are placed with distance 1 from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose <var>m</var>-1 points at random and cut the rope at these points to create <var>m</var> segments.
</p>
<p>
Let E(<var>n</var>, <var>m</var>) be the expected length of the second-shortest segment.
For example, E(3, 2) = 2 and E(8, 3) = 16/7.
Note that if multiple segments have the same shortest length the length of the second-shortest segment is defined as the same as the shortest length.

<h2>Problem 399: Squarefree Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
<p>
The first 15 fibonacci numbers are:<br />
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610.<br />
It can be seen that 8 and 144 are not squarefree: 8 is divisible by 4 and 144 is divisible by 4 and by 9.<br /> 
So the first 13 squarefree fibonacci numbers are:<br />
1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377 and 610.
</p>
<p>
The 200th squarefree fibonacci number is:
971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445.<br />
The last sixteen digits of this number are: 1608739584170445 and in scientific notation this number can be written as 9.7e53.
</p>
<p>
Find the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number.<br />
Give as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by a comma followed by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after the decimal point).<br />
For the 200th squarefree number the answer would have been: 1608739584170445,9.7e53

<p>
<font size="-1">
Note:<br /> 
For this problem, assume that for every prime p, the first fibonacci number divisible by p is not divisible by p<sup>2</sup> (this is part of <b>Wall's conjecture</b>). This has been verified for primes ≤ 3·10<sup>15</sup>, but has not been proven in general.<br />

If it happens that the conjecture is false, then the accepted answer to this problem isn't guaranteed to be the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number, rather it represents only a lower bound for that number.

<h2>Problem 400: Fibonacci tree game</h2>
<p>
A <b>Fibonacci tree</b> is a binary tree recursively defined as:</p><ul><li>T(0) is the empty tree.
</li><li>T(1) is the binary tree with only one node.
</li><li>T(<var>k</var>) consists of a root node that has T(<var>k</var>-1) and T(<var>k</var>-2) as children.
</li></ul><p>
On such a tree two players play a take-away game. On each turn a player selects a node and removes that node along with the subtree rooted at that node.<br />
The player who is forced to take the root node of the entire tree loses.</p><p>

</p><p>
Here are the winning moves of the first player on the first turn for T(<var>k</var>) from <var>k</var>=1 to <var>k</var>=6.
</p><p align="center"><img src="project/images/p400_winning.png" class="dark_img" alt="p400_winning.png" /></p>



Let <var>f</var>(<var>k</var>) be the number of winning moves of the first player (i.e. the moves for which the second player has no winning strategy) on the first turn of the game when this game is played on T(<var>k</var>).


<p>
For example, <var>f</var>(5) = 1 and <var>f</var>(10) = 17.
</p>

<p>
Find <var>f</var>(10000). Give the last 18 digits of your answer.
