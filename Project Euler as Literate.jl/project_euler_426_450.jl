<h2>Problem 426: Box-ball system</h2>
<p>
Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.
</p>
<p>
A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty box to its right.
</p>
<p>
After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied box.
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="project/images/p426_baxball1.gif" alt="p426_baxball1.gif" /></div>

<p>
A system like this is called a <b>Box-Ball System</b> or <b>BBS</b> for short.
</p>
<p>
It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of <b>occupied boxes</b> evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="project/images/p426_baxball2.gif" alt="p426_baxball2.gif" /></div>

<p>
We define the sequence {<var>t</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>}:<br /></p><ul><li><var>s</var><sub>0</sub> = 290797
</li><li><var>s</var><sub><var>k</var>+1</sub> = <var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub><sup>2</sup> mod 50515093
</li><li><var>t</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> = (<var>s</var><sub><var>k</var></sub> mod 64) + 1
</li></ul><p>
Starting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10</sub>), the final state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].<br />
Starting from the initial configuration (<var>t</var><sub>0</sub>, <var>t</var><sub>1</sub>, …, <var>t</var><sub>10 000 000</sub>), find the final state.<br />
Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>) is your answer.

<h2>Problem 431: Square Space Silo</h2>
<p>Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.</p>

<p>Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m<sup>3</sup>. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.</p>

<div class="center">
   <img src="project/images/p431_grain_silo.png" class="dark_img" alt="p431_grain_silo.png" /></div>

<p>We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.</p>

<p>Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.</p>

<p>If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\sum x$ correct to 9 decimal places.</p>

<h2>Problem 434: Rigid graphs</h2>
<p>Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.<br />
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a point in the Euclidean space.<br />
A <strong>flexible</strong> graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.<br />
A <strong>rigid</strong> graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.<br />
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the graph.
</p>
<p>The <strong>grid graphs</strong> embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the following animation demonstrates:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="project/images/p434_rigid.gif" class="dark_img" alt="p434_rigid.gif" /></div>
<p>However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph rigid:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="project/images/p434_rigid23.png" class="dark_img" alt="p434_rigid23.png" /></div>
<p>Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.
</p>
<p>Let <var>R</var>(<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>) be the number of ways to make the <var>m</var> × <var>n</var> grid graph rigid. <br />
E.g. <var>R</var>(2,3) = 19 and <var>R</var>(5,5) = 23679901

<h2>Problem 437: Fibonacci primitive roots</h2>
<p>
When we calculate 8<sup>n</sup> modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7.<br />
As we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a <b>primitive root</b> of 11.<br />
But there is more:<br />
If we take a closer look we see:<br />
1+8=9<br />
8+9=17≡6 mod 11<br />
9+6=15≡4 mod 11<br />
6+4=10<br />
4+10=14≡3 mod 11<br />
10+3=13≡2 mod 11<br />
3+2=5<br />
2+5=7<br />
5+7=12≡1 mod 11.
</p>
So the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8<sup>n</sup> + 8<sup>n+1</sup> ≡ 8<sup>n+2</sup> (mod 11).<br />
8 is called a <b>Fibonacci primitive root</b> of 11.<br />

<h2>Problem 444: The Roundtable Lottery</h2>
<p>A group of $p$ people decide to sit down at a round table and play a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to £$p$, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for all of the players to maximize the winnings of the ticket they hold upon leaving the game.</p>

<p>An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>The player can choose to scratch the ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.</li>
<li>If the player's ticket is unscratched, then the player may trade it with a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leaves the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches the newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.</li>
</ol>

<p>The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.</p>

<p>Assume that players will use the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of their ticket winnings.</p>

<p>Let $E(p)$ represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of $p$ players.<br />
E.g. $E(111) = 5.2912$ when rounded to 5 significant digits.</p>

<p>Let $S_1(N) = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^{N} {E(p)}$.<br />
Let $S_k(N) = \sum \limits_{p = 1}^{N} {S_{k-1}(p)}$ for $k \gt 1$.</p>

<p>Find $S_{20}(10^{14})$ and write the answer in scientific notation rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent. For example, the answer for $S_3(100)$ would be 5.983679014e5.</p>

<h2>Problem 450: Hypocycloid and Lattice points</h2>
