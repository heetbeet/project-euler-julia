<h2>Problem 126: Cuboid layers</h2>
<p>The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring 3 x 2 x 1 is twenty-two.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p126.png" class="dark_img" alt="" /><br /></div>
<p>If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.</p>
<p>However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5 x 1 x 1 also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5 x 3 x 1, 7 x 2 x 1, and 11 x 1 x 1 all contain forty-six cubes.</p>
<p>We shall define C(<i>n</i>) to represent the number of cuboids that contain <i>n</i> cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) = 8.</p>
<p>It turns out that 154 is the least value of <i>n</i> for which C(<i>n</i>) = 10.</p>

<h2>Problem 128: Hexagonal tile differences</h2>
<p>A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal tiles, starting at "12 o'clock" and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an anti-clockwise direction.</p>
<p>New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below shows the first three rings.</p>
<div class="center">

<p>By finding the difference between tile <i>n</i> and each of its six neighbours we shall define PD(<i>n</i>) to be the number of those differences which are prime.</p>
<p>For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29, 11, 6, 1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.</p>
<p>In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11, and 10, hence PD(17) = 2.</p>
<p>It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(<i>n</i>) is 3.</p>
<p>If all of the tiles for which PD(<i>n</i>) = 3 are listed in ascending order to form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.</p>

<p>Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection "angle of incidence equals angle of reflection." That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.</p>

For 56 ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ 4000000, <i>s</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> = [<i>s</i><sub><i>k−24</i></sub> + <i>s</i><sub><i>k−55</i></sub> + 1000000] (modulo 1000000) − 500000.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>s</i><sub>10</sub> = −393027 and <i>s</i><sub>100</sub> = 86613.</p>

<p>The terms of <i>s</i> are then arranged in a 2000×2000 table, using the first 2000 numbers to fill the first row (sequentially), the next 2000 numbers to fill the second row, and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).</p>

<h2>Problem 150: Searching a triangular array for a sub-triangle having minimum-sum</h2>
<p>In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the smallest possible.</p>
<p>In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p150.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>
<p>We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers <span style="font-style:italic;">s<sub>k</sub></span> in the range ±2<sup>19</sup>, using a type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator) as follows:</p>
<p class="margin_left"><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span> := 0
<br />
for k = 1 up to k = 500500:
<br />
    <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span> := (615949*<span style="font-style:italic;">t</span> + 797807) modulo 2<sup>20</sup><br />
    <span style="font-style:italic;">s<sub>k</sub></span> := <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span>−2<sup>19</sup></p>
<p>Thus: <span style="font-style:italic;">s<sub>1</sub></span> = 273519, <span style="font-style:italic;">s<sub>2</sub></span> = −153582, <span style="font-style:italic;">s<sub>3</sub></span> = 450905 etc</p>
<p>Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers thus:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
s<sub>1</sub><br />
s<sub>2</sub>  s<sub>3</sub><br />
s<sub>4</sub>  s<sub>5</sub>  s<sub>6</sub>  
<br />
s<sub>7</sub>  s<sub>8</sub>  s<sub>9</sub>  s<sub>10</sub><br />
...
</div>
<p>Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the next row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and so on).
<br />
The "sum of a sub-triangle" is defined as the sum of all the elements it contains.
<br />
Find the smallest possible sub-triangle sum.</p>
