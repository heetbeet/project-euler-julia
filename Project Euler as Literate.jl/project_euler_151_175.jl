<h2>Problem 151: Paper sheets of standard sizes: an expected-value problem</h2>
<p>A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.</p>

<p>Every Monday morning, the supervisor opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper with size A1.</p>

<p>The supervisor proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then one of the sheets is cut in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until an A5-size sheet is obtained, which is needed for the first batch of the week.</p>

<p>All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="project/images/p151.png" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>

<p>At the beginning of each subsequent batch, the supervisor takes from the envelope one sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, then it is used. If it is larger, then the 'cut-in-half' procedure is repeated until an A5-size sheet is obtained, and any remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.</p>

<p>Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number of times (during each week) that the supervisor finds a single sheet of paper in the envelope.</p>

<p>Give your answer rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxx .</p>

<h2>Problem 152: Writing 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares</h2>
<p>There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using <i>distinct</i> integers.</p>
<p>For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35} can be used:</p>
<p>$$\begin{align}\dfrac{1}{2} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{2^2} + \dfrac{1}{3^2} + \dfrac{1}{4^2} + \dfrac{1}{5^2} +\\
&amp;\quad \dfrac{1}{7^2} + \dfrac{1}{12^2} + \dfrac{1}{15^2} + \dfrac{1}{20^2} +\\
&amp;\quad \dfrac{1}{28^2} + \dfrac{1}{35^2}\end{align}$$</p>
<p>In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive, there are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being: {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45} and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}.</p>

<h2>Problem 153: Investigating Gaussian Integers</h2>
<p>As we all know the equation <var>x</var><sup>2</sup>=-1 has no solutions for real <var>x</var>.
<br />
If we however introduce the imaginary number <var>i</var> this equation has two solutions: <var>x=i</var> and <var>x=-i</var>.
<br />
If we go a step further the equation (<var>x</var>-3)<sup>2</sup>=-4 has two complex solutions: <var>x</var>=3+2<var>i</var> and <var>x</var>=3-2<var>i</var>.
<br /><var>x</var>=3+2<var>i</var> and <var>x</var>=3-2<var>i</var> are called each others' complex conjugate.
<br />
Numbers of the form <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> are called complex numbers.
<br />
In general <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> and <var>a</var>−<var>bi</var> are each other's complex conjugate.</p>
<p>A Gaussian Integer is a complex number <var>a</var>+<var>bi</var> such that both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are integers.
<br />
The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with <var>b</var>=0).
<br />
To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with <var>b</var> ≠ 0 we call such integers "rational integers."
<br />
A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer <var>n</var> if the result is also a Gaussian integer.
<br />
If for example we divide 5 by 1+2<var>i</var> we can simplify $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$ in the following manner:
<br />
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2<var>i</var>: 1−2<var>i</var>.
<br />
The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.
<br />
So 1+2<var>i</var> is a divisor of 5.
<br />
Note that 1+<var>i</var> is not a divisor of 5 because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i} = \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.
<br />
Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (<var>a</var>+<var>bi</var>) is a divisor of a rational integer <var>n</var>, then its complex conjugate (<var>a</var>−<var>bi</var>) is also a divisor of <var>n</var>.</p>
<p>In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2<var>i</var>, 1 − 2<var>i</var>, 2 + <var>i</var>, 2 − <var>i</var>, 5}.
<br />
The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:</p>
<table align="center" border="1"><tr><td width="20">
<var>n</var></td><td> Gaussian integer divisors<br />
with positive real part</td><td>Sum s(<var>n</var>) of <br />these

</tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1, 1+2<var>i</var>, 1-2<var>i</var>, 2+<var>i</var>, 2-<var>i</var>, 5</td><td>12</td>
</tr></table><p>For divisors with positive real parts, then, we have: $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{5} {s(n)} = 35$.</p>
<p>For $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{10^5} {s(n)} = 17924657155$.</p>

<h2>Problem 154: Exploring Pascal's pyramid</h2>
<p>A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.</p>

<h2>Problem 155: Counting Capacitor Circuits</h2>
<p>An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.
<br />
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.</p>
<p>Using this simple procedure and up to <var>n</var> identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up to <var>n</var>=3 capacitors of 60 $\mu$ F each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total capacitance values: </p>
<div class="center"><img src="project/images/p155_capacitors1.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>
<p>If we denote by <var>D</var>(<var>n</var>) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to <var>n</var> equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: <var>D</var>(1)=1, <var>D</var>(2)=3, <var>D</var>(3)=7 ...</p>
<p>Find <var>D</var>(18).</p>
<p><i>Reminder :</i> When connecting capacitors C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> etc in parallel, the total capacitance is C<sub>T</sub> = C<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub> +...,

whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by: $\dfrac{1}{C_T} = \dfrac{1}{C_1} + \dfrac{1}{C_2} + ...$</p>

<h2>Problem 156: Counting Digits</h2>
<p>Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base 10 like this:
<br />
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12....
</p>
<p>Consider the digit <var>d</var>=1. After we write down each number <var>n</var>, we will update the number of ones that have occurred and call this number <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1). The first values for <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1), then, are as follows:</p>
<div class="center">
<table class="center" align="center"><tr><td><var>n</var></td><td><var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1)</td>

</tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td>
</tr></table></div>
<p>Note that <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1) never equals 3.
<br />
So the first two solutions of the equation <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>,1)=<var>n</var> are <var>n</var>=0 and <var>n</var>=1. The next solution is <var>n</var>=199981.</p>
<p>In the same manner the function <var>f</var>(<var>n,d</var>) gives the total number of digits <var>d</var> that have been written down after the number <var>n</var> has been written.
<br />
In fact, for every digit <var>d</var> ≠ 0, 0 is the first solution of the equation <var>f</var>(<var>n,d</var>)=<var>n</var>.</p>
<p>Let <var>s</var>(<var>d</var>) be the sum of all the solutions for which <var>f</var>(<var>n,d</var>)=<var>n</var>.

<h2>Problem 158: Exploring strings for which only one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left</h2>

Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.<br />
When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.<br /> 
For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.<br />

<h2>Problem 165: Intersections</h2>
<p>A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.<br /> By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities:<br /> 
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.</p>
<p>Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.<br />
We will call a common point T of two segments L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> a true intersection point of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>  if T is the only common point of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>  and T is an interior point of both segments.
</p>
<p>Consider the three segments L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub>:</p>
<p class="margin_left">L<sub>1</sub>: (27, 44) to (12, 32)<br />
L<sub>2</sub>: (46, 53) to (17, 62)<br />
L<sub>3</sub>: (46, 70) to (22, 40)</p>
<p>It can be verified that line segments L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub> have a true intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of L<sub>3</sub>: (22,40) lies on L<sub>1</sub> this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub> have no common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.</p>
<p>Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate 20000 numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number generator.</p>
<p class="margin_left">s<sub>0</sub> = 290797<br /><br />
s<sub>n+1</sub> = s<sub>n</sub>×s<sub>n</sub> (modulo 50515093)<br /><br />
t<sub>n</sub> = s<sub>n</sub> (modulo 500)</p>
<p>To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers t<sub>n</sub>. That is, the first line segment is given by:</p>
<p>(t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>) to (t<sub>3</sub>, t<sub>4</sub>)</p>
<p>The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be: 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to (12,232).</p>

<h2>Problem 168: Number Rotations</h2>
<p>Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.<br />
It can be verified that 714285=5×142857.<br />
This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.</p>

<h2>Problem 169: Exploring the number of different ways a number can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2</h2>
<p>Define f(0)=1 and f(<var>n</var>) to be the number of different ways <var>n</var> can be expressed as a sum of integer powers of 2 using each power no more than twice.</p>
<p>For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:</p>
<p class="margin_left">1 + 1 + 8<br />
1 + 1 + 4 + 4<br />1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4<br />
2 + 4 + 4<br />

<h2>Problem 170: Find the largest 0 to 9 pandigital that can be formed by concatenating products</h2>
<p>Take the number 6 and multiply it by each of 1273 and 9854:</p>

<p class="margin_left">6 × 1273 =  7638<br />
6 × 9854 = 59124</p>

<p>By concatenating these products we get the 1 to 9 pandigital 763859124. We will call 763859124 the "concatenated product of 6 and (1273,9854)". Notice too, that the concatenation of the input numbers, 612739854, is also 1 to 9 pandigital.</p>

<p>The same can be done for 0 to 9 pandigital numbers.</p>

<p>What is the largest 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit concatenated product of an integer with two or more other integers, such that the concatenation of the input numbers is also a 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit number?</p>

<h2>Problem 175: Fractions involving the number of different ways a number can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2</h2>
Define f(0)=1 and f(<var>n</var>) to be the number of ways to write <var>n</var> as a sum of powers of 2 where no power occurs more than twice. <br /><br />

For example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:<br />10 = 8+2 = 8+1+1 = 4+4+2 = 4+2+2+1+1 = 4+4+1+1<br /><br />

It can be shown that for every fraction <var>p/q</var> (<var>p</var>&gt;0, <var>q</var>&gt;0) there exists at least one integer <var>n</var> such that<br /> f(<var>n</var>)/f(<var>n</var>-1)=<var>p/q</var>.<br /><br />
For instance, the smallest <var>n</var> for which f(<var>n</var>)/f(<var>n</var>-1)=13/17 is 241.<br />
The binary expansion of 241 is 11110001.<br />
Reading this binary number from the most significant bit to the least significant bit there are 4 one's, 3 zeroes and 1 one. We shall call the string 4,3,1 the <span style="font-style:italic;">Shortened Binary Expansion</span> of 241.<br /><br />
Find the Shortened Binary Expansion of the smallest <var>n</var> for which<br /> f(<var>n</var>)/f(<var>n</var>-1)=123456789/987654321.<br /><br />
