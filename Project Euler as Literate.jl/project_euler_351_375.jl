<h2>Problem 351: Hexagonal orchards</h2>

<h2>Problem 352: Blood tests</h2>
<p>
Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to affect 2% of the sheep population.
An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.
</p>

<p>
Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:<br /><br />
The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. 
For each group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,
</p><ul><li>If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.</li>
<li>If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).</li>
</ul><p>
Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:
</p><ul><li>Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.98<sup>5</sup> = 0.9039207968.</li>
<li>Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.</li>
</ul><p>
Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 × 5 = 1.480396016.<br />
Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 × 5 = <b>7.40198008</b> tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !
</p>

<p>
Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:
</p><ul><li>We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.</li>
<li>If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).</li>
<li>We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.</li>
</ul><p>
To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.
</p>
For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the <i>optimal strategy</i>) requires an average of just <b>4.155452</b> tests!


<p>
Using the optimal strategy, let T(<var>s</var>,<var>p</var>) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of <var>s</var> sheep for a virus having probability <var>p</var> to be present in any individual.<br />
Thus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.

<h2>Problem 353: Risky moon</h2>
<p>
A moon could be described by the sphere $C(r)$ with centre $(0,0,0)$ and radius $r$. 
</p>

<p>
There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of $C(r)$ with integer coordinates. The station at $(0,0,r)$ is called North Pole station, the station at $(0,0,-r)$ is called South Pole station.
</p>

<p>
All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on the great arc through the stations. A journey between two stations is risky. If <var>d</var> is the length of the road between two stations, $\left(\frac{d}{\pi r}\right)^2$ is a measure for the risk of the journey (let us call it the risk of the road). If the journey includes more than two stations, the risk of the journey is the sum of risks of the used roads.
</p>

<p>
A direct journey from  the North Pole station to the South Pole station has the length $\pi r$ and risk 1. The journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station via $(0,r,0)$ has the same length, but a smaller risk:</p>
\[
\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi r}{\pi r}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi r}{\pi r}\right)^2=0.5
\]

<p>
The minimal risk of a journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station on $C(r)$ is $M(r)$.

<h2>Problem 359: Hilbert's New Hotel</h2>
<p>
An infinite number of people (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.) are lined up to get a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.). 
</p>

<p>
Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup> person is assigned a room: person <var>n</var> gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:
</p><ul><li>the floor is empty</li>
<li>the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that floor is person <var>m</var>, then <var>m</var> + <var>n</var> is a perfect square</li>
</ul><p>
Person 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.
<br />Person 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect square.
<br />Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.
<br />Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.
</p>

<p>
Define P(<var>f</var>, <var>r</var>) to be <var>n</var> if person <var>n</var> occupies room <var>r</var> in floor <var>f</var>, and 0 if no person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:
<br />P(1, 1) = 1
<br />P(1, 2) = 3
<br />P(2, 1) = 2
<br />P(10, 20) = 440
<br />P(25, 75) = 4863
<br />P(99, 100) = 19454

$\dfrac{Q_0 R_0}{Q_0 Q_1} = \dfrac{Q_1 R_1}{Q_1 Q_2} = t$ for the same value of $t$.</p>

<h2>Problem 371: Licence plates</h2>
<p>
Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit number (each digit can be from [0..9]).<br />
While driving to work Seth plays the following game:<br />
Whenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add to 1000 that's a win.
</p>
<p>
E.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too (as long as he sees them in the same trip). 
</p><p>
</p><p>
Find the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win.<br />
Give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.

<h2>Problem 374: Maximum Integer Partition Product</h2>
<p>An integer partition of a number <var>n</var> is a way of writing <var>n</var> as a sum of positive integers.</p>

<p>Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same.
A partition of <var>n</var> into <b>distinct parts</b> is a partition of <var>n</var> in which every part occurs at most once.</p>

<p>The partitions of 5 into distinct parts are:
<br />5, 4+1 and 3+2.</p>

<p>Let f(<var>n</var>) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of <var>n</var> into distinct parts and let m(<var>n</var>) be the number of elements of any such partition of <var>n</var> with that product.</p>

<p>So f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.</p>

<p>For <var>n</var>=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives f(10)=30 and m(10)=3.
<br />And their product, f(10)·m(10) = 30·3 = 90</p>

<p>It can be verified that
<br /><span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">∑</span></span> f(<var>n</var>)·m(<var>n</var>) for 1 ≤ <var>n</var> ≤ 100 = 1683550844462.</p>
